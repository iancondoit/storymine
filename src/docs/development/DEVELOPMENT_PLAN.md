# StoryMine Development Plan

This document outlines the development approach, architecture, and implementation plan for the StoryMine application.

## Project Vision

StoryMine is a web application that helps media professionals and researchers discover and connect historical news stories through an AI chatbot interface named Jordi. The application leverages a PostgreSQL database populated by the StoryMap ETL pipeline, containing hundreds of thousands of processed news articles with entity recognition, vector embeddings, and thematic tagging.

## Development Approach

We will follow a test-driven development (TDD) approach with the following principles:

1. Write tests before implementation
2. Build incrementally with regular validation
3. Maintain comprehensive documentation
4. Focus on code quality and maintainability
5. Regular review and refactoring

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - Next.js (React framework)
  - TypeScript
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - Jest for testing

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js with Express
  - TypeScript
  - PostgreSQL client for database access
  - LangChain for LLM integration
  - Jest for testing

- **Infrastructure**:
  - Docker for containerization
  - GitHub Actions for CI/CD
  - Vercel for deployment (frontend)
  - Railway or similar for backend hosting

```

The system consists of:

1. **Frontend Application**: Next.js web application providing the user interface
2. **Backend API**: Node.js server handling database queries and business logic
3. **PostgreSQL Database**: Database populated by StoryMap with articles, entities, and vector embeddings
4. **LLM Service**: Integration with a language model service for the Jordi chatbot functionality

## Testing Strategy

We will implement a comprehensive testing strategy:

1. **Unit Tests**: Individual functions and components
   - Backend: Database access, data processing, API endpoints
   - Frontend: React components, state management, utilities

2. **Integration Tests**: Interactions between components
   - API endpoint integration with database
   - Frontend to backend communication
   - LLM service integration

3. **End-to-End Tests**: Complete user flows
   - Chat conversation scenarios
   - Article discovery journeys
   - Story threading functionality

4. **Performance Tests**: System under load
   - Database query performance
   - API response times
   - Frontend rendering performance

## Initial Tasks

To begin immediate development, the following tasks should be completed:

1. Initialize Next.js frontend application
2. Set up Node.js backend server
3. Create database connection module
4. Implement basic article retrieval endpoint
5. Build simple chat interface mockup
6. Write initial tests for core functionality

## Documentation Plan

We will maintain the following documentation:

1. README.md - Project overview and getting started
2. API documentation - Endpoints, parameters, and response formats
3. Database schema documentation - Tables, fields, and relationships
4. Architecture documentation - System components and interactions
5. Development setup guide - Setting up local environment
6. Deployment guide - Deploying to staging and production

## Conclusion

This development plan outlines a structured approach to building the StoryMine application following test-driven development principles. By following this plan, we aim to create a high-quality, maintainable application that effectively serves the needs of media professionals and researchers exploring historical news archives.
