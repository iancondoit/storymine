# StoryMine Development Roadmap

This document outlines the two major development initiatives for StoryMine and provides a prioritized plan for implementation.

## Project Overview

StoryMine is a web application that helps users discover and connect historical news stories through Jordi, an AI chatbot interface. The application leverages the StoryMap API to access a database of news articles with entity recognition, vector embeddings, and thematic tagging.

## Major Development Initiatives

There are two major initiatives that need to be completed:

1. **Implement Real StoryMap API Integration**: Replace the mock StoryMap API with the real API to access actual article data.
2. **Enhance Jordi's Capabilities**: Significantly improve Jordi's intelligence, interaction abilities, and access to additional data sources.

## Priority Recommendation: Implement StoryMap API Integration First

**Rationale**:
- Provides the foundation for Jordi to access real and comprehensive data
- Allows meaningful testing and training of Jordi with authentic content
- Enables proper development of entity relationships and vector search
- Must be in place before Jordi can provide truly valuable insights

## Initiative 1: Real StoryMap API Integration

   - Set up error handling and retry mechanisms
   - Create staging and production configurations

2. **API Client Enhancement** ✅
   - Update StoryMap API client to handle real API responses
   - Implement proper error handling and rate limiting
   - Add comprehensive logging

3. **Connection Testing** ✅

   - Create monitoring for API availability and performance
   - Implement fallback mechanisms for API outages

### Phase 2: Data Model Integration ✅

1. **Schema Alignment** ✅
   - Ensure database models match StoryMap schema
   - Add support for any additional fields or relationships
   - Create data validation for incoming API data

2. **Query Optimization** ✅
   - Implement efficient query patterns for article retrieval
   - Set up caching for frequently accessed data
   - Create performance metrics for API requests

3. **Entity and Relationship Mapping** ✅
   - Enhance entity extraction from articles
   - Build relationship graph between entities
   - Implement versioning for entity data

### Phase 3: Search and Vector Integration ✅

1. **Vector Search Implementation** ✅
   - Connect to StoryMap vector embeddings
   - Implement semantic search functionality
   - Create relevance scoring for search results

2. **Search Enhancement** ✅
   - Add filters for publications, dates, and categories
   - Implement faceted search capabilities
   - Create search analytics for query improvement

3. **API Integration Testing** ✅
