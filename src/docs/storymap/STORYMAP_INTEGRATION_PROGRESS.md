# StoryMap API Integration Roadmap

This document tracks the progress and future plans for integrating StoryMine with the StoryMap API.

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: API Connection Setup

1. âœ… **Environment Configuration**
   - Created ApiEnvironment enum for different environments (mock, development, staging, production)
   - Implemented environment-specific API URL configuration
   - Set up authentication methods (none, API key, OAuth)

2. âœ… **API Client Enhancement**
   - Created StoryMapApiClient class with comprehensive methods
   - Implemented authentication headers based on environment
   - Added logging for requests and responses
   - Implemented retry mechanisms using axios-retry

3. âœ… **Connection Testing**
   - Created testing framework for StoryMap API client
   - Implemented ping method for API availability checking
   - Added fallback mechanisms for connection failures

### Partially Completed Work

1. ðŸ”„ **Error Handling**
   - Added error classification (connection, authentication, validation)
   - Implemented rate limiting detection and handling
   - Need to add application-level retry strategies

2. ðŸ”„ **Test Coverage**
   - Created unit tests for API client methods
   - Added mock error handling for testing
   - Need more integration tests for the real API

## Comprehensive Integration Plan

### Phase 1: Environment Configuration

1. **Create .env Template Files**:
   - Create `.env.example` files for both backend and frontend with all required variables
   - Document every variable with clear descriptions
   - Include multiple port options to avoid conflicts

2. **Standardize Environment Configuration**:
   - Replace hardcoded URLs in the StoryMapApiClient with environment variables
   - Create a shared config.ts file that loads all environment variables with validation

3. **Port Management**:
   - Reserve specific ports for each service to avoid conflicts
   - Document port assignments in README files
   - Add automatic port detection and fallback in the server.ts file

### Phase 2: Connection to Real StoryMap API

1. **API Client Enhancement**:
   - Update the StoryMapApiClient to support proper retry mechanisms
   - Add comprehensive error handling with detailed logging
   - Implement connection pooling to maintain persistent connections

2. **Authentication Implementation**:
   - Properly implement JWT authentication for StoryMap API
   - Add token refresh logic to handle expiration
   - Create a test script to validate authentication

3. **API Integration Test Suite**:
   - Create dedicated test scripts to verify each API endpoint
   - Add automated health checks for API connectivity
   - Implement integration tests that can run against the real API

### Phase 3: Data Flow Implementation

1. **Data Synchronization**:
   - Implement proper fetch and cache strategies for StoryMap data
   - Add background jobs to periodically sync data
   - Add error recovery mechanisms for failed requests

2. **API Response Transformation**:
   - Create consistent data mappers to transform StoryMap API responses
   - Implement schema validation for incoming data
   - Add data normalization to ensure consistency

3. **Pagination and Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement proper pagination for large datasets
   - Add rate limiting awareness to avoid API throttling
   - Create intelligent retry strategies for rate-limited requests

### Phase 4: Reliability and Monitoring

1. **Reliability Improvements**:
   - Add circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures
   - Implement fallback mechanisms for critical endpoints
   - Create redundancy for critical operations

2. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Enhance logging with structured log format
   - Add performance metrics for API calls
   - Create dashboard for API connection status

3. **Error Recovery**:
   - Implement automated recovery for common failure scenarios
   - Add proper notification for critical failures
   - Create self-healing mechanisms where possible

## Implementation Priorities

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **API Connection Testing**
   - Create test script to validate StoryMap API connection with detailed logging
   - Test connection from various environments
   - Document exact connection requirements

2. **Authentication Fix**
   - Fix JWT authentication implementation in StoryMapApiClient
   - Add token refresh mechanisms
   - Create authentication test script

3. **Environment Management**
   - Create comprehensive .env.example files
   - Update StoryMapApiClient to properly handle environment variables
   - Fix port conflict issues in the development environment

### Medium-Term Goals

1. **Data Flow Optimization**
   - Implement proper caching for frequently accessed data
   - Add pagination helpers for large datasets
   - Create data transformers for API responses

2. **Error Handling Improvements**
   - Implement circuit breaker pattern
   - Add detailed error logging
   - Create automated recovery for common errors

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Create comprehensive test suite for StoryMap API
   - Add automated tests for CI/CD pipeline
   - Create documentation for testing against real API

### Long-Term Goals

1. **Reliability and Scalability**
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Add load balancing for API requests
   - Create redundancy for critical operations

2. **Monitoring and Observability**
   - Add metrics collection for API performance
   - Create dashboards for monitoring
   - Implement alerting for API issues

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Implement real-time data synchronization
   - Add background processing for large operations
   - Create advanced caching strategies
