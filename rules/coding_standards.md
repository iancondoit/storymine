# StoryMine Coding Standards

## Overview

This document defines the coding standards that all StoryMine components must follow. Adhering to these standards ensures consistency, maintainability, and effective collaboration across the project.

## General Principles

### 1. Code Quality
- **Readability**: Code should be self-documenting with clear variable names and logical structure
- **Simplicity**: Prefer simple, straightforward solutions over complex ones
- **Consistency**: Follow established patterns within the codebase
- **Modularity**: Write reusable, well-defined functions and components

### 2. Documentation
- **Comments**: Explain why something is done, not just what is done
- **README files**: Every major component should have clear setup and usage instructions
- **API documentation**: All public interfaces should be documented
- **Architecture decisions**: Document significant technical choices and trade-offs

### 3. Error Handling
- **Graceful degradation**: Handle errors appropriately without crashing
- **Logging**: Use appropriate log levels (error, warn, info, debug)
- **User feedback**: Provide meaningful error messages to users
- **Recovery**: Implement retry logic where appropriate

## Language-Specific Standards

### TypeScript/JavaScript
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations
- Implement proper error boundaries in React components
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Prefer const/let over var
- Use template literals for string interpolation

### Python
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Implement proper exception handling
- Use virtual environments for dependency management
- Write docstrings for functions and classes

### SQL
- Use descriptive table and column names
- Implement proper indexing strategies
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Follow consistent naming conventions (snake_case)

## File Organization

### Directory Structure
```
src/
├── backend/           # Backend API and services
├── frontend/          # Next.js frontend application
├── docs/             # Project documentation
└── scripts/          # Utility and deployment scripts
```

### Naming Conventions
- **Files**: Use kebab-case for file names
- **Directories**: Use camelCase or kebab-case consistently
- **Components**: Use PascalCase for React components
- **Variables**: Use camelCase in JavaScript/TypeScript, snake_case in Python
- **Constants**: Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- **Database**: Use snake_case for tables and columns

## Version Control

### Git Practices
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Use branching strategy appropriate to team size
- Tag releases with semantic versioning
- Include relevant issue numbers in commit messages

### Commit Message Format
```
feat: add user authentication system
fix: resolve database connection timeout
docs: update API documentation
refactor: simplify article search logic
```

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- Write unit tests for core business logic
- Implement integration tests for API endpoints
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Maintain test coverage above 80% for critical paths

### Test Organization
- Co-locate tests with source code when possible
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## Security

### Best Practices
- Never commit secrets or API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Use HTTPS for all external communications
- Follow principle of least privilege for database access
- Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities

### API Security
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Validate and sanitize all input parameters
- Log security-relevant events
- Use CORS policies appropriately

## Performance

### Frontend Performance
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- Optimize images and static assets
- Use efficient state management patterns
- Minimize bundle size
- Implement proper caching strategies

### Backend Performance
- Use appropriate database indexes
- Implement connection pooling
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Monitor query performance
- Use efficient algorithms and data structures

### Database Performance
- Design efficient schema with proper relationships
- Use appropriate data types
- Implement query optimization
- Monitor slow queries
- Use database-specific optimization features

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- Use JSDoc for JavaScript/TypeScript functions
- Include parameter types and return values
- Document complex algorithms and business logic
- Explain non-obvious code decisions

### Project Documentation
- Maintain up-to-date README files
- Document API endpoints with examples
- Include setup and deployment instructions
- Document configuration options and environment variables

## Deployment and Operations

### Environment Management
- Use separate environments for development, staging, and production
- Implement infrastructure as code where possible
- Use consistent deployment procedures
- Monitor application health and performance

### Monitoring and Logging
- Implement structured logging with appropriate levels
- Monitor key performance indicators
- Set up alerts for critical issues
- Use distributed tracing for complex operations

## Code Review Process

### Review Guidelines
- Review for logic, security, and performance issues
- Check adherence to coding standards
- Verify test coverage for new functionality
- Ensure documentation is updated as needed
- Provide constructive feedback

### Pull Request Standards
- Include clear description of changes
- Reference related issues or tickets
- Include test results and coverage information
- Update relevant documentation
- Keep pull requests focused and reasonably sized

## Continuous Integration

### Build Process
- Automate testing on every commit
- Run linting and code quality checks
- Build and test in clean environments
- Generate test coverage reports
- Deploy automatically to staging environments

### Quality Gates
- All tests must pass before merging
- Code coverage must meet minimum thresholds
- Security scans must pass
- Performance benchmarks must be maintained
- Documentation must be updated

## Conclusion

These standards serve as guidelines to ensure high-quality, maintainable code across the StoryMine platform. They should be reviewed and updated regularly as the project evolves and new best practices emerge.
