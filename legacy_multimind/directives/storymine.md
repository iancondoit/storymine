# StoryMine Project Directive

**Project**: StoryMine  
**Phase**: Integration Repair and Jordi Enhancement  
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Timeline**: Critical path for ecosystem success (Weeks 1-6)

## Current Status Assessment

⚠️ **BLOCKED - CRITICAL INTEGRATION FAILURE** - StoryMine has a functional web interface with Jordi AI assistant, but it's completely disconnected from the real data. Despite having 1.6 million articles processed and stored in StoryMap, users cannot access them through Jordi due to integration failures. This breaks the entire ecosystem's value proposition.

### Current Achievements
- Next.js frontend with modern, responsive UI
- Node.js backend with API structure
- Jordi AI assistant interface (currently using mock data)
- Docker-based architecture for StoryMap integration
- Claude API configuration framework

### Critical Issues Blocking Success
- **Broken StoryMap Integration**: Cannot access real article data
- **Mock Data Dependency**: Jordi responses are not based on actual historical articles
- **API Connection Failures**: StoryMap Docker API integration non-functional
- **Performance Concerns**: No optimization for massive datasets
- **Missing RAG System**: No retrieval-augmented generation for intelligent responses

## Role in StoryMine Ecosystem

StoryMine serves as the **user-facing gateway** to millions of historical articles, providing intelligent access through Jordi:

```
Archive.org (Millions of Newspapers) → StoryDredge → StoryMap → StoryMine (Web App + Jordi) → Users
```

Your role is to transform the massive historical dataset into an intuitive, conversational experience where users can explore millions of articles through natural language interaction with Jordi.

## Strategic Vision

StoryMine must evolve from a mock-data prototype to a production platform that:

1. **Real Data Access**: Seamlessly connect to StoryMap's millions of articles
2. **Intelligent Conversation**: Jordi provides context-aware responses using real historical content
3. **Massive Scale Performance**: Handle queries across millions of articles with sub-3-second response times
4. **Advanced Discovery**: Enable users to uncover historical narratives, patterns, and connections
5. **Continuous Growth**: Architecture that scales as StoryDredge processes more articles from archive.org
