# Project Completion: StoryMine - StoryMapIntegrationFix

Version: 0.1.0
Completed: 2025-05-26
Project: StoryMine
Phase: StoryMapIntegrationFix

## Completed Directives

* Fixed StoryMap API integration after Flask to FastAPI migration
* Updated all API endpoint paths from `/api/*` to direct paths (`/articles`, `/entities`)
* Restored backend connectivity to StoryMap API with proper error handling
* Implemented correct article count reporting (222 total articles)
* Enhanced pagination support to handle full dataset retrieval
* Verified individual article retrieval functionality

## Deliverables

* Updated StoryMap API client: `src/backend/src/services/storyMapApiClient.ts`
* Updated StoryMap API service: `src/backend/src/services/storyMapApi.ts`
* Enhanced article controller: `src/backend/src/controllers/articleController.ts`
* Updated project status: `reports/status.md`
* Working backend API on port 3003 with full StoryMap integration

## Known Issues

* StoryMap API still lacks advanced search and entity relationship features
* Some endpoints (like `/entities`) are not yet implemented in StoryMap API
* Backend logs show some connection attempts to Docker internal hosts that timeout (but fallback to localhost works)

## Notes

The integration fix was critical as the StoryMap API had migrated from Flask to FastAPI, changing the endpoint structure. The backend now successfully connects to the StoryMap API at `http://localhost:8080` and can retrieve all 222 historical articles from 1922-1925. The system properly handles pagination and individual article retrieval.

The fix involved:
1. Removing `/api` prefix from all endpoint calls
2. Updating response format handling to work with direct array responses
3. Implementing proper total count calculation for pagination
4. Increasing maximum page size to accommodate the full dataset

## Next Phase

The next phase should focus on:
* Frontend integration with the working backend API
* Implementing Jordi AI assistant with access to real historical data
* Completing the user interface for article browsing and search
* Adding enhanced search capabilities when StoryMap API supports them
