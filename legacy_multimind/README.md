# Legacy MultiMind Files

This directory contains files and references from the MultiMind project management system that were previously integrated with StoryMine. These files have been moved here to clean up the codebase and remove confusion for future development.

## Contents

### `/rules/` - MultiMind Project Management Rules
- `completion_reporting.md` - Completion reporting protocols
- `handoff_protocol.md` - Inter-component handoff procedures  
- `project_boundaries.md` - Project boundary definitions
- `roadmap_updates.md` - Roadmap update processes
- `status_format.md` - Status reporting formats

### `/scripts/` - MultiMind Utilities
- `complete_phase.py` - Phase completion script for MultiMind orchestration

### `/output/` - MultiMind Generated Files
- Completion notifications and generated reports from MultiMind system

### `/advisories/`, `/directives/`, `/reports/`
- Various MultiMind project management artifacts

## Why These Files Were Moved

These files were part of a larger MultiMind ecosystem that included project management orchestration, inter-project communication protocols, and automated reporting systems. As StoryMine has evolved into a standalone documentary research platform, these MultiMind-specific files were no longer relevant to the core functionality.

## What Was Preserved

The valuable development standards from these files were preserved and adapted for StoryMine in:
- `rules/coding_standards.md` - Updated for StoryMine-specific development practices
- `rules/ephemeral_files.md` - Retained policies for clean development practices

## Current StoryMine Status

StoryMine is now a fully independent, production-ready documentary story discovery platform with:
- ✅ Next.js frontend with React and TypeScript
- ✅ Express.js backend with comprehensive API
- ✅ PostgreSQL database with 282K+ historical articles
- ✅ Claude AI integration for sophisticated documentary analysis
- ✅ Railway deployment with 99.9% uptime
- ✅ Advanced search and documentary scoring algorithms

## Archive Date

These files were moved to legacy status on: January 2025

For current StoryMine development, refer to the main project documentation and active rules in the `/rules/` directory.
