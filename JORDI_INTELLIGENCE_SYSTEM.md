## Technical Implementation

### Backend Intelligence Stack

#### Core Service: `claudeNarrativeService.ts`
```typescript
// Intelligence-powered story discovery
async getCuratedStoryOptions(options: {
  category?: string;
  yearRange?: string; 
  count?: number;
}): Promise<any>

// Deep story analysis with documentary scoring
async exploreStoryInDepth(storyId: string, focus?: string): Promise<any>

// Story-focused conversation with historical context
async storyFocusedChat(storyId: string, message: string, history: any[]): Promise<any>
```

#### Smart Database Queries
- **Documentary potential filtering**: `WHERE documentary_potential > 0.02`
- **Category-specific searches**: `primary_themes @> '[\"Politics\"]' OR content ILIKE '%politics%'`

## Intelligence Scoring System

### StoryMap Intelligence Data Structure

Each article contains sophisticated pre-scoring:

```json
{
  "id": "article_id",
  "storymap_id": "unique_story_identifier", 
  "title": "Historical story title",
  "content": "Full article text",
  "publication_date": "1925-03-15",
  "documentary_potential": 0.85,     // 0-1.0 scoring
  "narrative_score": 0.78,           // Story structure quality
  "archival_richness": 0.72,         // Available supporting materials
  "evidence_quality": 0.91,          // Source reliability and detail
  "source_reliability": 0.88,        // Publication trustworthiness  
  "primary_themes": ["Politics", "Women's Rights"],
  "secondary_themes": ["Legal Reform", "Social Change"],
  "story_categories": ["Documentary-worthy", "Character-driven"],
  "primary_location": "Atlanta, GA",
  "historical_period": "1920s"
}
```

### Documentary Potential Categories
- **90%+ (Exceptional)**: Compelling characters, rich archival materials, strong visual potential
- **70-89% (High)**: Strong narrative elements, good source material, clear documentary angle  
- **50-69% (Moderate)**: Interesting story with development potential, some supporting materials
- **30-49% (Limited)**: Historical significance but limited visual/narrative appeal
- **Below 30%**: Primarily informational value

## Technical Notes for Developers

### Key Implementation Decisions
1. **Two-tier system**: Separate discovery and conversation interfaces for different use cases
2. **Intelligent fallbacks**: System remains functional even when full intelligence unavailable  
3. **Category-first filtering**: Visual button interface vs. dropdown menus for better UX
4. **Smart pagination**: Limited results prevent interface overwhelm from massive dataset
5. **Contextual conversation**: Story-specific chat maintains focus and relevance

### Critical Success Factors
- **StoryMap Intelligence integration**: Pre-scored data enables smart discovery vs. random sampling
- **Enhanced filtering system**: Category + year range combination provides precise story targeting
- **Documentary potential scoring**: Visual indicators help users identify highest-value stories
- **Graceful degradation**: System works with curated examples when full database unavailable
- **Production-ready insights**: Actionable documentary development guidance vs. just story discovery

*Last Updated: June 8, 2025 - Comprehensive system rebuild and intelligence integration*

## CRITICAL: Article Content Access Solution

### The NULL Content Problem

**Issue**: The StoryMap Intelligence database contains 282,388 articles, but the `content` fields are frequently NULL/empty, preventing full-text analysis for documentary story generation.

**Root Cause**: ETL pipeline issues during article content extraction from historical newspaper archives (1920-1961 Atlanta Constitution).

**Solution Implemented**: 
1. **Dual Content Field Strategy**: Query both `content` AND `processed_content` fields
2. **Content Validation**: Filter for articles with substantial content (>100 characters)
3. **Fallback Strategy**: Use entity/relationship data when content unavailable
4. **Intelligence-First Approach**: Leverage pre-scored documentary_potential metrics

### Technical Implementation

```sql
-- Content Access Query Pattern
SELECT content, processed_content 
FROM intelligence_articles 
WHERE (content IS NOT NULL AND length(content) > 100)
   OR (processed_content IS NOT NULL AND length(processed_content) > 100)
```

**Content Priority Order**:
1. `processed_content` (StoryMap's enhanced text)
2. `content` (raw OCR text)  
3. Entity relationship analysis (fallback)
4. Legacy curated examples (final fallback)
