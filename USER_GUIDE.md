## üöÄ The Smart Batching Breakthrough

### Why This Changes Everything

**The Problem Every Documentary Researcher Faces:**

- **Processes 500 articles per request** (not just 5-10)
- **Batches of 50 articles each** to stay within AI token limits
- **Expert documentary analysis** applied to every batch
- **Results combined and ranked** by genuine documentary potential
- **Scales to millions of articles** from any news archive

### How It Works
1. **Query Processing**: Select category and time period
2. **Intelligent Batching**: System divides 500 articles into 10 batches of 50
3. **Expert Analysis**: Each batch gets full documentary evaluation from Claude AI
4. **Professional Curation**: Results ranked by documentary potential (60-95%)
5. **Continuous Discovery**: "Give me more" processes next 500 articles with no duplicates
