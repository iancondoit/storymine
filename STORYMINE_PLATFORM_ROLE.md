# StoryMine Platform Role Definition

## Core Mission Statement

**StoryMine's sole job is to receive quality information and present it to users.**

StoryMine is a **presentation and mining platform** - not an analysis platform. We do not analyze, clean, score, or process raw data. We only present pre-analyzed, high-quality information provided by intelligence systems.

## What StoryMine Does

### ✅ PRESENTATION FUNCTIONS
- **Display** pre-analyzed documentary stories
- **Present** documentary potential and narrative scores
- **Show** verified themes and categories
- **Filter and sort** by provided metadata
- **Enable discovery** through intelligence-provided tags
- **Render** clean, formatted story content
- **Provide** user interface for story exploration

### ✅ MINING FUNCTIONS
- **Search** through pre-categorized content
- **Filter** by intelligence-provided criteria
- **Sort** by pre-calculated scores and metrics
- **Navigate** through verified historical periods
- **Browse** by validated geographic locations
- **Discover** connections through provided metadata

## What StoryMine Does NOT Do

### ❌ ANALYSIS FUNCTIONS
- **Analyze** raw article content
- **Generate** documentary potential scores
- **Create** narrative quality assessments
- **Determine** themes or categories
- **Process** or interpret raw data
- **Score** content for documentary value

### ❌ DATA CLEANING FUNCTIONS
- **Clean** OCR data or correct digitization errors
- **Fix** corrupted titles or content
- **Repair** concatenated words or formatting issues
- **Validate** data quality or accuracy
- **Transform** raw newspaper data
- **Correct** metadata or geographic information

### ❌ INTELLIGENCE FUNCTIONS
- **Decide** what constitutes a good story
- **Evaluate** historical significance
- **Assess** narrative potential
- **Categorize** content by themes
- **Verify** factual accuracy
- **Determine** documentary value

## Data Requirements

StoryMine requires **quality-assured input data** with:

### Required Data Quality Standards
- **Clean titles:** Proper newspaper headlines (not OCR fragments)
- **Readable content:** OCR-corrected article text with proper formatting
- **Validated scores:** Documentary potential and narrative scores (0.0-1.0)
- **Verified metadata:** Accurate themes, locations, and dates
- **Complete articles:** Full story content (minimum 500 characters)
- **Proper formatting:** Correct spacing and punctuation

### Data Source Responsibility
- **Intelligence systems** are responsible for data analysis and quality assurance
- **StoryMine** is responsible only for presentation and user experience
- **No analysis or cleaning** should be performed within StoryMine
- **All intelligence work** must be completed before data reaches StoryMine

## Architecture Principle

```
Intelligence System → Quality Data → StoryMine → User Experience
     (Analysis)      (Clean Input)  (Presentation)   (Discovery)
```

### NOT This:
```
Raw Data → StoryMine → Analysis → Presentation → User
          (Wrong - StoryMine should not analyze)
```

## Integration Requirements

When integrating with intelligence systems:

### Intelligence System Must Provide:
1. **Pre-analyzed content** with quality scores
2. **Clean, formatted data** ready for presentation
3. **Validated metadata** and categorization
4. **Quality assurance** before data delivery
5. **Complete processing** of all analysis tasks

### StoryMine Will Provide:
1. **User interface** for story discovery
2. **Presentation layer** for analyzed content
3. **Search and filtering** capabilities
4. **User experience** optimization
5. **Display formatting** and navigation

## Quality Assurance Boundary

**Intelligence System Responsibility:**
- Data accuracy and completeness
- Content analysis and scoring
- OCR correction and cleaning
- Metadata validation
- Theme categorization
- Historical verification

**StoryMine Responsibility:**
- User interface quality
- Presentation formatting
- Search functionality
- Navigation experience
- Display performance
- User interaction design

## Error Handling

If StoryMine receives poor quality data:
- **Do not attempt to fix or analyze** the data
- **Document the quality issues** found
- **Request corrected data** from intelligence system
- **Do not deploy** with corrupted or incomplete data
- **Maintain quality standards** for user experience

## Success Metrics

StoryMine success is measured by:
- **User engagement** with presented stories
- **Discovery effectiveness** through provided metadata
- **Presentation quality** of intelligence-analyzed content
- **Search and filtering** functionality
- **User satisfaction** with story exploration

StoryMine success is NOT measured by:
- Quality of data analysis (intelligence system responsibility)
- Accuracy of content scoring (intelligence system responsibility)
- Data cleaning effectiveness (intelligence system responsibility)

## Summary

**StoryMine receives quality information. That is all.**

We are a presentation platform that showcases the excellent work of intelligence systems. We do not compete with or duplicate intelligence functions. We focus entirely on delivering the best possible user experience for exploring pre-analyzed, high-quality documentary content.
